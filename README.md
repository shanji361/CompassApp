## Reference 
- Compass Degree Markers: Used AI to design the logic for drawing compass degree markers around the circle, including differentiating between major markers (every 30°) and minor markers (every 10°).

- Cardinal Direction Mapping: Used AI to create the function that converts the azimuth (0–360° heading) into human-readable compass directions like N, NE, E, etc., based on specific degree ranges.
